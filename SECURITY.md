# Security Policy

scout-reporting is a Go library that reads and verifies attestation
statements other software will make admission decisions on. Its security
posture is about one thing: a statement that `Validate` accepts says what
it appears to say.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security issues through [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/scout-reporting/security/advisories/new). Do not open a public issue.

You will receive an acknowledgement within **72 hours**. A confirmed
vulnerability is fixed and released within **90 days** of the report, or
sooner when a fix is straightforward; if the window cannot be met you will
be told why and given a revised date.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported. The version is scout's; see the
lockstep rule in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Security Measures

Each item names the test that enforces it, so the claim can be checked
rather than taken on trust.

- **The subject digest is recomputed, never trusted.** `Validate` derives
  the digest from the predicate's target descriptor and compares it with
  the subject's; a statement whose displayed subject was rewritten to
  name another server fails. `attestation_test.go` covers the tampered
  cases: renamed subject, altered digest, a second subject, a mismatched
  predicate type.
- **A score without its rubric is invalid.** A number nobody can
  recompute is not a claim; `Validate` refuses it.
- **No network, no files, no dependencies.** The package imports only the
  standard library and touches nothing outside the bytes it is given, so
  a hostile statement has no side channel to reach. `go.mod` has no
  `require` directive and CI's `govulncheck` runs on every push.
- **The schema is derived from the types**, by `scripts/specgen`, and CI
  fails when the committed file drifts, so a consumer validating by
  schema and one validating by this package agree.
- **Signatures are out of scope here.** This package checks the
  statement's structure and integrity. Whether the bytes came from who
  they claim is the job of the envelope around them — DSSE, cosign,
  `gh attestation verify` — and scout's manual describes how to sign a
  statement and check the signature. A consumer must do both.
