// Package attestation is the scout MCP evaluation attestation: the in-toto
// statement a run produces about one MCP server, and everything needed to
// read and verify one offline.
//
// It is the public half of scout's attestation format, in its own module
// under Apache-2.0 rather than the engine's GPL, and it imports only the
// standard library — so a gateway, registry or CI system can embed it to
// verify a statement without taking on the engine's licence or its
// dependency graph (scout's ADR 0011). The JSON Schema in spec/attestation
// is generated from these types. Producing a statement from a report is
// scout's job and lives in the engine; checking one is anybody's.
//
// The reason this exists rather than "just use the JSON report" is that the
// report is a document and this is a claim. A document is read by a person; a
// claim is verified by a machine that was not present when the run happened —
// a gateway deciding whether to route to a server, a registry deciding what
// to display, an auditor deciding whether a control was met in March.
//
// It is an in-toto statement, so it slots into a pipeline enterprises are
// already being forced to build: the same envelope as SLSA provenance and an
// SBOM, the same signing, the same verification. Owning a predicate type is
// more durable than owning a product category, because formats outlive both.
//
// Four properties are deliberate, and each is a constraint rather than a
// nice-to-have:
//
//   - It states what it was judged against. A verdict with no basis has no
//     shelf life: "82/100" means nothing in 2029 unless the rubric and the
//     specification revision are attached to it.
//   - The subject digest is over a target descriptor, and the statement says
//     so. A digest that looked like an artifact hash while covering a URL
//     would be the kind of lie that survives review.
//   - It carries the verdict for every check that ran, not only the failures.
//     A consumer cannot otherwise tell "checked and fine" from "not checked",
//     which for a conformance tool is the whole difference.
//   - It verifies offline. A gateway must never have to call scout to trust a
//     statement scout produced.
